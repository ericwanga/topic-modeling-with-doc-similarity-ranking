The project aims to increase the knowledge and skills required to address climate adaptation, biodiversity and well-being in the urban, green living environment, and to broaden the expertise among professionals in Europe.
The European Platform for Urban Greening (EPLUG) aims to intensify the collaboration within the knowledge triangle (VET – Research & Development – Business) to facilitate these adjustments and to develop high quality curricula and qualifications focused on these urban greening skills needs and societal challenges.
The network aims to increase the quality and adaptability of the skills ecosystem (VET, Companies, Policy makers, Individuals) for urban green landscaping. As driver of excellence and innovation, each European CoVE on Urban Greening promotes the proactive role for VET in local/regional development.

In early summer 2022, AhlmanEdu (Tampere, Finland) started a pilot project to improve soil quality in green areas. The experiment is being carried out in a lawn and a perennial bed and is part of the EPLUG project in the green sector.
The trial will test the impact of AhlmanEdu’s bioactive compost on soil biology and plant health in green areas.  The plots from the lawn and perennial bed were divided into three different parts. The first part was treated with the bioactive compost extract and the second with a conventional fertiliser. The third plot served as a reference plot, irrigated with the same amount of clean water.
The initial soil biological assessment showed that the soil food web in the area was depleted. It was rich in bacteria but almost devoid of fungi, which are a very important part of the soil because they are involved in nutrient cycling. Protozoa and beneficial nematodes were completely absent from the soil, but harmful root-eating nematodes were abundant. In order for soil to provide an ecosystem service, i.e. to support plants, it needs to contain all the beneficial functional groups of organisms.
After the first application, the soil of all six plots was examined microbiologically under a microscope and the difference with the first plots was visible. Fungi increased and beneficial nematodes and protozoa were found.
A soil food web is a soil ecosystem made up of different micro-organisms. Together with plants, it controls the ecological processes in the soil.
A balanced soil food web supports healthy plant growth by recycling nutrients and improving soil structure. It also prevents the development of diseases and pests and controls the growth of weeds. Tillage and pesticides upset the balance of the food web, so that the soil no longer functions well.

Dozens of plants are currently growing in parking lots on the São Paulo Drive in Overvecht, a neighborhood in the Dutch city of Utrecht.
The plants deliberately occupy a parking space and if a car drives over it, a small piece of nature is destroyed. But if they are still intact in a few days, you may wonder how much use those parking spaces actually have. That is exactly what social designers Lisa Strijbosch and Maartje de Goede are currently investigating.
The experiment was realized in collaboration with the Fietsersbond (Bicycle Union). “We work together with them and that’s how we started looking at the street in a different way,” explains Maartje. “We noticed that cars take up a lot of space in the city. The parking spaces on the São Paulo Drive are reserved for potential cars, but they are almost always empty. You could use that public space for so many better purposes.”
The plants were placed on May 6th. “We have been a little disobedient and poured earth into six parking spaces and then put a colorful collection of rescued plants in it. There is also a large yellow sign that says: parking experiment in progress.”
The reactions in the neighborhood are very positive, says Maartje. “The neighborhood is taking very good care of the plants. We water the plants every day, but local residents think they should get more water. So they water the plants too, including children with water guns. So that’s very nice.”
The experiment has already been successful, says Maartje. “We hope, of course, that the plants can stay and that the result will be sent to the municipality to speed up the process a bit, so that nature gets a little more space in the city and cars a little less.”
