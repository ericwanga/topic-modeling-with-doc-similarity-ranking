Since Valencia is the city with Europe's longest park, the location of one of the largest urban redevelopments turning a former railstation into an lush green area for citizens to relax and one of the candidates to become Europe's Green Capital in 2024, there was little doubt where the second face to face meeting of the European Platform for Urban Greening had to be organized.
From 21 till 23 March, companies and schools from six different countries discussed the latest developments in the field of Urban Greening, so our cities remain livable, healthy and biodiverse living environments. Field trips to the Turia park and Valencia central park sparked inspiration and enthusiasm among the participants, while they discussed how to enhance the public private collaboration in and between their countries. 
Local hosts, VET school EFA La Malvesia, company Projar and the municipality of Valencia captured the meeting in the video below.

The European Platform for Urban Greening has been up and running for a year now. A good moment to reflect on what these Centers of Vocational Excellence in the field of Urban Greening have achieved so far, but also to look ahead to the plans for 2022. Each region in the network has identified the needs of companies, NGOs, governments and VET providers working on Urban Greening.Low hanging fruit has been picked and plans for 2022 are made, so the platform can continue to enhance the knowledge and skills that will help European cities to adapt to climate change, improve the biodiversity and make sure that our cities are pleasant places to live and work.
