About STF
The Scottish Training Federation (STF) represents over 140 organisations operating in the field of work based training across Scotland.
STF members comprise a broad mix of independent training providers, group training associations, colleges and local authority training departments – and cover a wide range of occupational areas, from traditional craft apprenticeships through to service sector occupations.
The majority of STF members are involved in the delivery of government funded training including Modern Apprenticeships and Employability Fund programmes in Scotland.
Lobbying activity
STF is widely regarded as the ‘voice of training providers in Scotland’ operating in the work based training industry and is regularly consulted by all of the key stakeholders on policy development and implementation.
The STF Chief Executive and Board Members have regular meetings with senior staff at Skills Development Scotland and Scottish Government to lobby on behalf of members.
Member workshops
Free workshops are held every month to update members on policy changes and new initiatives such as Apprenticeship Development and Funding, Meta Skills, Employability and No One Left Behind developments, Foundation and Graduate Apprenticeships, Young Person’s Guarantee, Compliance, SQA Review, Flexible Workforce Development Fund and the National Transition Training Fund.
Member groups 
The STF Care Forum is a long standing group which focusses on all issues relating to the care sector. The group is chaired by Lorna Trainer and currently has around 20 members.
The STF Member Employability Group was set up in mid 2021 to address member concerns relating to the transfer of employability services funding from national to local control. The group is chaired by Maureen McCann and has around 20 members.
Other short life groups are set up regularly to address specific issues in specific occupational sectors or to address cross cutting single issues such as the level of apprenticeship funding rates.
