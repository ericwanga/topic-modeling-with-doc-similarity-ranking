Green Academy is the educational platform of the Green European Foundation (GEF). It is for all of us in the green movement and beyond, empowering green-minded Europeans to get organised, get educated and get ready to tackle todayâ€™s challenges and ones ahead of us.
From the climate crisis and biodiversity loss to rising inequality and the threats to democracy: we have work to do. Green Academy offers all of us the knowledge and skills to work on the solutions together.
Once you enroll in our courses, you get access to the best new ideas from across the green movement and European civil society, including top experts, politicians and activists.
We cover everything from the European Union, ecology and migration to activism, campaigning and combating hate speech online. Each course is built as an interactive experience, offering the flexibility to focus on what you care about most and to go at your own pace.
